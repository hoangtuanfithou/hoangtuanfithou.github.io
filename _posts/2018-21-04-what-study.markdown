This time I try something:
- Go: just a little bit. reason : my friend said that Grab changed to that language because of it performance.
- Node JS: because it is popular and is using at my company
[https://www.tutorialspoint.com/nodejs/index.htm]()
- React native : it is also is using by Seedly team

It is not good, not focus.

So I must think, choose then focus to 1 thing only.

Btw, in that time do not forget to improve current needed skill.
