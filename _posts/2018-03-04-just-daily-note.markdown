I hate the idea that when try to blog, must have something news, some things special to write.
So today I just write because I want to write some thing and try the jekyll platform for more.

Today is first day I try to join Badminton group with my friend.
So I am right, sport is good, but sport with team and friend is much much more better.
I always go to gym center or biking, hiking alone, but it can not compare.
So keep it, and continue.

In the afternoon, I go to the public library and find that 2 floor is nice for working.
It is raining outside. ðŸ›¤

And in the evening 1 people will visit to check the single room.

That is my day, Sunday.
