I see the gate and remember about the story from Japan: that the gate still there after long time, while many other thing were destroy after war, time ...

So today is the very first day of me to come back the library, acds I did when I was a student.
The Gate to knowledge alway there.
Just because of us want to come or not.

So I hope I can keep coming for a long time.
