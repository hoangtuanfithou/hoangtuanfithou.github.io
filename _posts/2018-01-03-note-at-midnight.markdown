Just an other testing.
Bom is in ...

With Ruby installed, install Jekyll from the terminal:

## Installation
`gem install jekyll bundler`
Create a new Gemfile to list your projectâ€™s dependencies:

`bundle init`
Edit the Gemfile in a text editor and add jekyll as a dependency:

`gem "jekyll"`
Run bundle to install jekyll for your project.

`bundle exec`

## Build

Since Jekyll is a static site generator, it has to build the site before we can view it. Run either of the following commands to build your site:

- `jekyll build` - Builds the site and outputs a static site to a directory called _site.
- `jekyll serve` - Does jekyll build and runs it on a local web server at http://localhost:4000, rebuilding the site any time you make a change.

Bundle instal:
An error occurred while installing racc (1.5.2), and Bundler cannot
continue.
Make sure that `gem install racc -v '1.5.2' --source 'https://rubygems.org/'`
succeeds before bundling.
